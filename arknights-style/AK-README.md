# How to Use
1. Create a new work skin. You can read the basics [here](https://archiveofourown.org/faq/tutorial-creating-a-work-skin?language_id=en).
2. Copy and paste [this code](https://github.com/Clover-Zero/ao3-dialog/blob/main/arknights-style/ak-style-css.css) in CSS section.
3. The code contains everything you might want, including some customization options. You can edit it as you wish.
4. Submit the work skin. **Please note that the prefix `#workskin` will be automatically added.**
4. Open or create the AO3 work you want. Find **"Select Work Skin"** and find in the work skin you just created.
5. Copy and paste [this code](https://github.com/Clover-Zero/ao3-dialog/blob/main/arknights-style/ak-style-html.html) in your work (HTML mode). To make this process easier, you can try things out in [AO3 Workskin Sandbox](https://raw.githack.com/jdm/ao3sandbox/main/index.html).
6. Edit it and add things appropiately. I think it's pretty straightforward.
7. **Please note that AO3 tends to screw the formatting.** AO3 also removes the comments. You can use external applications to edit and preview it first.
