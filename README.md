An AO3 work skin based on gadaursan's [Fire Emblem Support Scripting](https://archiveofourown.org/works/8631214/chapters/21337784) work skin, a HTML and CSS to format screenplay and scripts (or dialog-only/dialog-heavy works), but with some edits.

Live example [here](https://archiveofourown.org/works/24349453/chapters/58715851).

**Current version: Version 3**

# Features
- Responsive, looks good on all devices.
- Text box/speech bubble, colored and not.
- Character's name.
- Character's icon.

# Planned Features
- Thought bubbles.
- Background images.
- Automation in Google Sheets.
- A version where the character and speech bubble are on the left and right, alternating.
- A version where it can be used in other websites, such as Dreamwidth. This is most likely far better to be used with automation.

# How to Use
1. Create a new work skin. You can read the basics [here](https://archiveofourown.org/faq/tutorial-creating-a-work-skin?language_id=en).
2. Copy and paste [this CSS code](https://github.com/Clover-Zero/ao3-dialogue/blob/main/basic-css.css) in CSS section.
3. The code contains everything you might want, including some customization options. You can edit it as you wish.
4. Submit the work skin. **Please note that the prefix `#workskin` will be automatically added.**
4. Open or create the AO3 work you want. Find **"Select Work Skin"** and find in the work skin you just created.
5. Copy and paste [this HTML code](https://github.com/Clover-Zero/ao3-dialogue/blob/main/basic-html.html) in your work (HTML mode).
6. Edit it and add things appropiately. I think it's pretty straightforward. To make this process easier, you can try things out in [AO3 Workskin Sandbox](https://raw.githack.com/jdm/ao3sandbox/main/index.html).
7. **Please note that AO3 tends to screw the formatting.** AO3 also removes the comments. You can use external applications to edit and preview it first.
