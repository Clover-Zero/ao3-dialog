Live example [here](https://archiveofourown.org/works/24349453/chapters/58715851).

**Current version: Version 3**

# Features
- Mobile responsive.
- Text box/speech bubble.
- Character's name.

# Planned Features
- Thought bubbles.
- Background images.
- Arknights-style text boxes.
- Automation in Google Sheets.
- Make a version where the CSS is in the HTML script so it can be used in Dreamwidth and other sites. This is most likely far better to be used with automation.
